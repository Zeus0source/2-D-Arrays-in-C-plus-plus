# Aim: To study and implement C++ 2D Array - Matrices
# Software Required :
Visual Studio
# Theory:

A multi-dimensional array can be defined as an array that has more than one dimension. Having more than one dimension means that it can grow in multiple directions. Some popular multidimensional arrays include 2D arrays which grows in two dimensions, and 3D arrays which grows in three dimensions.

2D Array:

A two-dimensional array in C++ is a collection of elements organized the form of rows and columns. It can be visualized as a table or a grid.

Like 1D arrays, 2D arrays can also be initialized using a list of values enclosed inside {} curly brackets, but as 2D arrays have two dimensions, the list is nested inside another list to initialize each dimension one by one. It means that each row values are nested inside one big list.

# Implementation:
In this programs the usage of 2D arrays was implemented using several codes which are,
+ Displaying A matrix
+ Addition of Matrix
+ Multiplication of Matrices
+ Diagonal Addition of Matrix
+ Trnaspose of a Matrix


# Conclusion:
The implementation of 2D arrays was done using the above codes.
